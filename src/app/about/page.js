              I hold a Master&apos;s Degree in Media Technology and Interaction
              Design from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I developed a
              fascination for human-computer interaction. As a design and
              front-end development consultant, I have a strong foundation in
              user-centered design and bridge the gap between design and code,
              creating intuitive, seamless user experiences. I specialize in
              crafting scalable design systems and turning creative visions into
              functional, responsive applications. My work is driven by a
              passion for both aesthetics and functionality, ensuring every
              project I tackle both looks beautiful and works flawlessly across
              all devices.

              I thrive in collaborative environments where teams work across
              disciplines to bring ideas to life. I&apos;m passionate about
              continuous feedback loops and use real-time user insights to
              refine and improve designs. I believe the best solutions emerge
              when we combine creativity and technical expertise with a deep
              understanding of end users.

              Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring
              new hobbies, and taking on creative projects. Whether I&apos;m
              experimenting with new tools, diving into a good book, or enjoying
              outdoor adventures, I&apos;m always seeking fresh sources of
              inspiration and nurturing my curiosity.
